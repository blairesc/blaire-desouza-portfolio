Hi! Iâ€™m Blaire deSouza, a software developer currently immersed in the tech hub of the New York City Metropolitan area.
 
4 years experience developing software, inlcuding APIs and websites for companies. I believe in building the right teams, and facilitating their accomplishment to successfully delivery various projects. 

My unique blend of strategic oversight and development proficiency allows me to effectively communicate with technical and non-technical team members, and ensure every project objectives aligns. I balance my world of computer screens with the refreshing experiences of nature and travels. 

I am eager to bring my dual expertise in project management and software development to transformative projects. I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with dynamic teams!
