Hello again! I am a front end web developer that graduated from Florida Atlantic University with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with honors. I am currently based in the New York Metropolitan area.

I love combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design and attention to details
to create beautifully efficient applications. My passion for coding stems the feeling of 
accomplishment when a bug has been fixed. When I am not in front of a computer screen, I am 
being active outside.

I am excited to contribute my skills to the right company while working along side other 
amazing programmers and learning so much more.
