Hello again! I am a front end web developer with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from
Florida Atlantic University. I am now based in the New York Metropolitan area.

I love combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design and attention to details
to create beautifully efficient applications. My passion for coding stems from the feeling of 
accomplishment when I have fixed a bug. When I am not in front of a computer screen, I am 
being active outside.

I am excited to contribute my skills to the right company while working along side other 
amazing programmers and learning so much more.
