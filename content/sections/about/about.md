Hi! Iâ€™m Blaire deSouza, a digital project manager currently immersed in the tech hub of the New York City Metropolitan area.
 
4 years experience developing digital products, whether that is APIs or creative digital journeys for companies. I believe in building the right teams, and facilitating the success of such teams to successfully delivery various projects. 

My unique blend of strategic oversight and development proficiency allows me to effectively communicate with technical and non-technical team members, and ensure every project objectives align. I balance the world of computer screens with the refreshing experiences of nature and travels. 

I am eager to bring my dual expertise in project management and software development to transformative projects. I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with dynamic teams!
